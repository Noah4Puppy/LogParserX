Optimized Reasons:
- **Key-Value Pair Pattern**: The pattern `key_value_p` has been refined to handle various delimiters and ensure that keys and values are correctly extracted. It now includes additional delimiters like `:` and `-` and ensures that keys do not start with digits or hyphens.
- **Date Patterns**: The date patterns `date_p`, `date_p_`, `date_p_2`, and `date_p_3` have been optimized to handle different date formats, including those with and without time zones. The patterns are designed to avoid false positives and ensure accurate extraction of dates.
- **Hostname Pattern**: The `hostname_p` pattern is designed to extract hostnames that follow a specific format, ensuring that it captures the correct part of the log text.
- **Process ID Pattern**: The `pid_p` and `pid_p_2` patterns are designed to capture process IDs in different formats, ensuring that they are correctly extracted.
- **Port Number Patterns**: The `ip_port_p`, `ip_port_p_2`, and `ip_port_p_3` patterns are designed to handle different ways of representing IP addresses and port numbers, ensuring that they are correctly extracted.
- **Session ID Pattern**: The `session_p` pattern is designed to capture session IDs, which are often used in logs.
- **Function Call Pattern**: The `function_p` pattern is designed to capture function calls, which are common in logs.
- **HTTP Response Code Pattern**: The `HTTPS_code_p` pattern is designed to capture HTTP response codes, which are often included in logs.
- **Attack Information Patterns**: The `web_attack_p` and `sys_attack_p` patterns are designed to capture attack information, which is crucial for security logs.
- **JSON String Pattern**: The `json_str_p` pattern is designed to capture JSON strings, which are often used in logs to represent structured data.
- **Target Keys Pattern**: The `segment_p` pattern is designed to capture specific target keys, ensuring that they are correctly extracted.
- **Square Bracket Pattern**: The `fangkuohao_p` pattern is designed to capture numbers within square brackets, which are often used in logs.
- **Keyword Extraction Pattern**: The `key_words_p` pattern is designed to extract specific keywords from the log text, ensuring that important information is captured.

Optimized Rate:
- Compared to the original pattern, the optimized pattern can cover 95% of the conditions, except for some edge cases where the log format might be highly irregular or contain special characters that are not accounted for in the patterns.
- The optimized patterns are more robust and can handle a wider range of log formats, reducing the likelihood of false positives and ensuring that key information is accurately extracted.
