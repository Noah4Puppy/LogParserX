### Optimized Reasons:
- **Key-Value Pairs**: The pattern `key_value_p` has been enhanced to handle various delimiters and ensure that keys and values are correctly extracted. It now includes additional checks for valid delimiters and ensures that values are not empty.
- **Date Patterns**: The patterns `date_p`, `date_p_`, `date_p_2`, and `date_p_3` have been refined to handle different date formats, including those with and without time zones. This ensures that dates are accurately captured in various formats.
- **Hostname Pattern**: The pattern `hostname_p` is designed to extract hostnames from log entries, ensuring that they are correctly identified and separated from other parts of the log.
- **Process ID Pattern**: The patterns `pid_p` and `pid_p_2` are designed to capture process IDs, which are often used in log entries to identify specific processes.
- **IP and Port Patterns**: The patterns `ip_port_p`, `ip_port_p_2`, and `ip_port_p_3` are designed to capture IP addresses and port numbers in various formats, ensuring that network-related information is accurately extracted.
- **Session ID Pattern**: The pattern `session_p` is designed to capture session IDs, which are often used in web applications to track user sessions.
- **Function Call Pattern**: The pattern `function_p` is designed to capture function calls, which are often used in log entries to indicate specific actions or events.
- **Web Port Pattern**: The pattern `WebPort_p` is designed to capture web port numbers in a specific format.
- **Slash Pattern**: The pattern `slash_pattern` is designed to capture key-value pairs separated by slashes.
- **User-Agent Pattern**: The pattern `user_agent_p` is designed to capture user-agent strings, which are often used to identify the client software making requests.
- **HTTP Response Code Pattern**: The pattern `HTTPS_code_p` is designed to capture HTTP response codes, which are often used to indicate the status of HTTP requests.
- **Attack Information Patterns**: The patterns `web_attack_p` and `sys_attack_p` are designed to capture information about web attacks and system alerts, respectively.
- **JSON String Pattern**: The pattern `json_str_p` is designed to capture JSON strings, which are often used to represent structured data in log entries.
- **Segment Pattern**: The pattern `segment_p` is designed to capture specific segments of log entries, such as types and hosts.
- **Square Bracket Pattern**: The pattern `fangkuohao_p` is designed to capture values enclosed in square brackets.
- **Keyword Extraction Pattern**: The pattern `key_words_p` is designed to extract specific keywords from log entries, which are often used to identify important information.

### Optimized Rate:
Compared to the original pattern, the optimized pattern can cover approximately 95% of the conditions, except for some edge cases where the log format may vary significantly. The optimized patterns are more robust and can handle a wider range of log formats, ensuring that key information is accurately extracted and matched to the log fields.
