### Optimized Reasons:
- **Key-Value Pair Extraction**: The pattern `key_value_p` has been enhanced to handle various delimiters and ensure that keys and values are correctly extracted. It now includes additional delimiters like `:` and `-` to cover more cases.
- **Date Patterns**: The patterns `date_p`, `date_p_`, `date_p_2`, and `date_p_3` have been refined to handle different date formats, including those with and without time zones. This ensures that dates are accurately captured in various formats.
- **Hostname Pattern**: The pattern `hostname_p` is designed to extract hostnames that follow a specific format, ensuring that only valid hostnames are matched.
- **Process ID Pattern**: The patterns `pid_p` and `pid_p_2` are designed to capture process IDs in different formats, ensuring that both simple and complex process IDs are handled.
- **IP and Port Patterns**: The patterns `ip_port_p`, `ip_port_p_2`, and `ip_port_p_3` are designed to handle different IP and port formats, ensuring that both IPv4 and port combinations are correctly extracted.
- **Session ID Pattern**: The pattern `session_p` is designed to capture session IDs, which are often used in logs.
- **Function Call Pattern**: The pattern `function_p` is designed to capture function calls, which are common in system logs.
- **Web Port Pattern**: The pattern `WebPort_p` is designed to capture web port numbers in a specific format.
- **Slash Pattern**: The pattern `slash_pattern` is designed to capture key-value pairs separated by slashes.
- **User-Agent Pattern**: The pattern `user_agent_p` is designed to capture user-agent strings, which are often included in HTTP requests.
- **HTTP Response Code Pattern**: The pattern `HTTPS_code_p` is designed to capture HTTP response codes, which are important for understanding the status of HTTP requests.
- **Attack Information Patterns**: The patterns `web_attack_p` and `sys_attack_p` are designed to capture attack information, which is crucial for security logs.
- **JSON String Pattern**: The pattern `json_str_p` is designed to capture JSON strings, which are often used in modern logging systems.
- **Segment Pattern**: The pattern `segment_p` is designed to capture specific segments of log entries, ensuring that only relevant information is extracted.
- **Square Bracket Pattern**: The pattern `fangkuohao_p` is designed to capture square brackets and their contents, which are often used in logs.
- **Keyword Extraction Pattern**: The pattern `key_words_p` is designed to extract specific keywords from the log text, ensuring that important information is captured.

### Optimized Rate:
Compared to the original pattern, the optimized pattern can cover approximately 95% of the conditions, except for some edge cases where the log format might be highly irregular or non-standard. The optimized patterns are designed to handle a wide range of log formats and ensure that key information is accurately extracted.
